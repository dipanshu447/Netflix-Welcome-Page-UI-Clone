# Netflix-Welcome-Page-UI-Clone

This project is a recreation of Netflix's older welcome page UI, built with HTML and CSS.

The primary goal of this project was to practice front-end development skills, understand how real-world web layouts are designed, and learn the process of building a complete project.

Through this project, I gained insights into:

- Designing a professional-looking page.
